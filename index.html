        <h1 class="title-left">Hi, I'm Tess!</h1>
    <p class="left">I am a software engineer and recent graduate of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive.</h1>
    <h1 class="title-left">About Me</h1>
    <p class='left'>I bring an accelerated learning style and ambitious creativity to design and support software that I love. I have the ability to connect and communicate with customers to understand software complexities and resolve problems.</p>

    <p class="left">I have a background in creative problem solving and a history of working directly with customers in a variety of settings. While I was working in technical education I trained and educated instructors. This experience taught me excellent customer service skills as well as how to train new employees. 
    </p>
    <p class="left">This experience brought me West from Washington, DC to Denver, Colorado then eventually to Salt Lake City where I learned extensively about the outdoor industry in order to be a sales representative at Powderbird Helicopter Skiing.</p>

    <p class="left">My journey to software engineering has not been traditional and it's my diverse experience that makes me a well rounded professional with a thoughtful approach to technical problem solving.</p>

    <h1 class="title-left">I look forward to working with you! </h1>
